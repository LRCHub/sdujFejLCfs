```
Until you crash, until you burn
Until you lie, until you learn
Until you see, until you believe
Until you fight, until you fall
Until the end of everything at
all
Until you die, until you're
alive
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Until you give, until you've
used
Until you're lost, until you
lose
Until you see, how could you
believe?
Until you've lived a thousand
times
Until you've seen the other side
This is my chance, this is my
chance
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Until the truth becomes a lie
Until you change, until you deny
Until you believe
This is my chance, this is my
chance
I'll take it now because I can
This is my chance, I want it now
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
(I don't care)
Save me, save me
(I don't care)
Save me, save me
(I don't care)
Save me, save me
(I don't care)
I don't care
(I don't care)
