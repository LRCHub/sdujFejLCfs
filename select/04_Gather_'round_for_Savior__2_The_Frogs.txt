(Backwards at beginning "Savior number three")

I'm thinking of a bird I love
And every time I think the bees gather around me
And children start to play at my feet
And the tangerine rabbits play too
And the woods are filled with children laughing
Laughing amongst themselves as if it's some joke
Known only to themselves

But they're laughing because they've gone
They've gone to their last church, mass
They've given up on church
Because they've found something else
I'm here for the kids

Oh kids disposing of bibles near my feet
Oh parents gather in a rage
Oh oh I took up this life
When I was half their age

Ah kids singin' like they know
What they're singin' about
Kids following my words
Screaming, scream and shouting about
The way my eyes look

There's a certain gleam
That is unlike that of any parent
Oh a gleam they know and love
The kids need not worry when they're with me

Oh drop your bibles kids and gather 'round
Ah listen to the sound
And listen to what you've always known
To what you've always been
To what you will always see
And gather 'round for savior #2
