I'm watching the mountains I'm watching the sea
Observing the creatures I am lost - set me free

Across the heavens I made my way
I've seen empires rise and blown away
I have arrived at my destiny but after all
There's just emptiness in me

Out in the darkness - I am going mad
Where are the others - there's silence in my head

'Cause I'm a watcher in the sky
I've seen unis die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky

I'm trapped in this nightmare
Endless tortures and pain, milleniums have gone by
Uhhh, it drives me insane

Who am I now?
I'm not man - I'm not machine
I gave my life away for the Iron Savior dream

'Cause I'm a watcher in the sky
I've seen unis die
Out in the cold my systems overload
I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky

(Piet) ed to the circuits of a lifeless, cold machine
Lost in a world of artificial means
Ripped out of my body
I'll stand the test of time
Am I perpetual? - am I divine?

I'm a watcher in the sky
My soul has drowned in the tears I cannot cry
I'm the watcher the chosen one but I am lost in time
I'm a watcher in the sky I've seen the years go by

I am the chosen one
Out in the cold my systems overload and I am lost in time
Watcher in the sky
Watching the mountains, watching the sea, watching the creatures
You'll never be free
Watcher in the sky
